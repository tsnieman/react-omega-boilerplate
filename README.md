# Install requirements
- Use a newer version of nodejs; I use `v6.3.1` (TODO be more specific about minimum requirement)
- Install [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) (used for unit testing) globally

# Oddities
**Note about warning which says "[react-router] You cannot change ; it will be ignored",**
-- this warning is harmless, we just can't disable it.
Discussion/PR: https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/pull/240#issuecomment-225879719

**Note about Redbox:** it won't hot-reload to show the red screen of death (rsod),
as react itself needs to be patch.
Discussion/PR: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6020

**css modules + `composes from` + babel-plugin-webpack-loaders = BAD**
Relevant bug: https://github.com/istarkov/babel-plugin-webpack-loaders/issues/97
The solution in this repo: [a custom loader](/blob/master/remove-composes.js) which removes 'composes' in test mode entirely.
This means that you shouldn't count on testing 'composes'-related stuff.

# TODO
- [ ] error system (well, more like a general 'alert' system)
- [ ] add explanations about each tech in [Pieces section](#Pieces)
- [x] testing
  - jest + webpack : https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-webpack.html
  - enzyme + jest + mocha(|ava|tape|jasmine) : https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/testing-react-components-with-enzyme-and-mocha
    - particularly interested in ava (avajs)
  - [ ] investigate [snapshot testing in jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)
  - [ ] [make react's proptype warnings throw errors while testing](https://gist.github.com/jsdf/6fc35890e4ed4a219072)
  - [ ] investigate [producthunt/chai-enzyme](/producthunt/chai-enzyme) ?
  - [writing redux tests](/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/recipes/WritingTests.md)
- test the prod config. (is probably very broken; the files are split where there should be differences for the most part, though)
- investigate style linting
  - via postcss: https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint
- consider other postcss plugins
  - css variables https://github.com/MadLittleMods/postcss-css-variables
  - map might be particularly handy https://github.com/pascalduez/postcss-map
  - http://postcss.parts/
- [ ] investigate setting up basic CLI generator (i.e. 'generate component MyComponent' -> outputs components in proper place)
- replace isomorphic fetch with fetch-wg or whatever (this boilerplate isn't isomorphic)
- consider switching to [redux-router](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-router) ([reasons](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-router#differences-with-react-router-redux))
- Icon + text alignments are kinda screwy. (especially in `IconButton`)
- IconButton taller than Button
- Read/control order of Card.Wrapper children
- Make a `<Text>` component which wraps its `children` in a div with style module `composes: body-text from 'styles/_typography.css';`
- **Move TODOs to github issues?**
